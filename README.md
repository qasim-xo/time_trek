##Motivation 
Motivation
I often find myself distracted, unable to focus for long periods, and experiencing mental fatigue. This project is an attempt to regain control of my attention span using the Pomodoro Technique â€” a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

The idea is to manage my focus and work in structured intervals to prevent burnout, and I decided to create an app that could help me implement this strategy more effectively.
